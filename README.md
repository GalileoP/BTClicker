# BTClicker
Instructions:
The application itself is simple but I will explain how it works. Since it is a clicker game you need to click on the button "Mine BTC" to collect BTC, based on clicker strength (level) that is how much BTC you will get per click. You can then transfer the bitcoins to EUR so you can buy computer components or stocks. Once you get the computer T1 it will automaticaly start collecting bitcoin, by upgrading components even further you will get more bitcoin per second. Max upgrade for clicker is lvl10 and max upgrade for computer is tier5, you need all components to be of the same tier if you want to upgrade a component to the next tier (for PC Case there is only 1 tier), so for example if you want to upgrade a component to tier3 you need to have all components tier2 first. You unlock stock market once you get pc tier1.
